# Sims 2 Content Restoration Script

This script is for easy moving of files and amending files in order to restore some of the lost content in **The Sims 2**.

Your gonna need this, your gonna need to find it, sorry(though if you have a copy, the only issue should come from the merge of the Ikea pack)

## What it Does

It will amend your VDF file to ensure it has the IKEA entry.
Copy the patched IKEA stuff over.
Copy all the known changed music packages into their respective sub-directories.
